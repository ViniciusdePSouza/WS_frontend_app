## About the aplication

This is an e-commerce platform, which serves as an MVP project. In the menu, all available categories are listed for the customer, along with an option called 'cart.' To the right, there are three banners showcasing selected products, and a carousel that lists all the products in that category along with their prices. After clicking the 'Buy Now' button, the product is added to the cart, which can be accessed by clicking the 'Cart' option in the menu.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
